# Colon-cancer-detection-using-Transfer-learning
This study investigates colorectal cancer classification using transfer learning. Pre-trained models like VGGNet, ResNet, and Inception extract features from histopathology images, which are then classified with machine learning techniques, offering insights into optimal strategies for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning.
